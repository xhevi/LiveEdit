# Live Edit

A simple Chrome extension tool to edit the site on-the-fly without need of console.

Usage instructions:
- To enable "Editing mode", click the red icon with a mouse, on the top right corner of the browser
- Based on element context you get a set of commands you can execute
- Double-click on a text element to quickly modify its content
- Right-click on any element and choose "Duplicate" from the context menu to clone that element
- Right-click and choose "Remove" to delete an element from the HTML document
- After page refresh, you are back in "Viewing mode"

Why is it useful?
- It's much faster than using the inspector for simple editing and screenshoting simple changes you may need to try and demonstrate on a page.
- "Live Edit" is a small component of a bigger framework, that allows the changes also to be propagated to a special form of backend via AJAX requests. The tool is under development, you should expect quite frequent updates with improvements and new features.

Please note that I'm a designer, not a developer, so my code is bad :) I do this stuff for fun. If you would like to contribute and help with the coding, contact  hi@xhevi.com
